-How did your user testing sessions go?
-What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
-Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?

-I thought that the testing went pretty well. It was interesting to get other people's perspectives on the site. 
-I changed the background from a grey color to a picture background but I left the grey as a backup background just in case. 
-I faced a few challenges that I will probably be scheduling a zoom meeting for to make sure things work better.  One of the challenges was 
the media queries. I was able to figure out how to get the background to change with the size of the screen but I wasn't able to get the spinning pictures on the homepage to change. Another problem that I have found is that though the background picture works great on my index.html page that opens in chrome, it doesn't seem to work in my github pages.  I have been looking all over to see why but I have found nothing on how to get a background-image url to work properly.
