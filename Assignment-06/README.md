## semantic and structural markup
Semantic markup and structural markup are two concepts that are closely related, but they refer to different aspects of the same thing: the way we mark up content on the web.

Semantic markup refers to the use of HTML tags to convey meaning to both human readers and search engines. Semantic markup emphasizes the meaning and purpose of the content, rather than its appearance.  Semantic markup helps search engines understand the content of a web page, which can improve search rankings and make the page more accessible to users with disabilities who rely on screen readers.

Structural markup, on the other hand, refers to the use of HTML tags to create the structure and layout of a web page. Structural markup is concerned with the visual presentation of the content rather than its meaning.  Structural markup is used to create a page's layout and visual hierarchy, but it doesn't necessarily provide any meaning or context to the content.
