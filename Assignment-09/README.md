## Forms
I have been using some of these stylistic features in some of my other assignments but this is the first time that I have used the nav elements.  It seems pretty straight forward but for the life of me I cannot seem to figure out how to get the home image and the nav buttons separated. I am anxious to learn more about CSS and stylistic aproaches to decorating the site.
